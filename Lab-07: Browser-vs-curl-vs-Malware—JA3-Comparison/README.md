# Lab-07: Browser vs curl vs Malware — JA3 Fingerprint Comparison

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to analyze and compare **JA3 TLS fingerprints** generated by different types of clients:

- A modern web browser  
- The `curl` command-line tool  
- Simulated malware-like TLS behavior  

This lab demonstrates how encrypted HTTPS traffic can still be **identified and classified** using TLS handshake metadata, even though payloads remain encrypted.

---

## Tools Used

- **Wireshark** – Packet capture and TLS analysis  
- **Web Browser** – Chrome / Firefox  
- **curl** – Command-line HTTP client  
- **JA3 Fingerprinting** – TLS client identification method  

---

## Key Concepts Covered

- TLS Client Hello structure  
- JA3 fingerprint generation  
- Client identification without decryption  
- Differences between legitimate and suspicious TLS behavior  

---

## Lab Environment

- **Client Types Tested**
  - Web browser
  - curl
  - Simulated malware-style TLS client
- **Network Type**
  - Local / controlled environment
- **Traffic Type**
  - HTTPS (TLS-encrypted)

---

## Lab Methodology

The lab was performed by generating HTTPS traffic from each client type while capturing packets using Wireshark.

For each connection:
1. The TLS Client Hello packet was identified
2. JA3-related fields were extracted
3. JA3 fingerprints were compared
4. Behavioral differences were analyzed

## Why This Matters

JA3 fingerprinting is widely used in:
- Network Detection & Response (NDR)
- Threat hunting
- Malware detection
- Zero-trust environments

This lab highlights why **encryption alone does not guarantee anonymity**.
