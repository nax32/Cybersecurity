This is what Pegasus-like attacks use.

 What it is

The link triggers a software vulnerability (browser, messaging app, OS).

No file needed.
Sometimes no click needed (zero-click).

 Why it’s rare
	•	Uses unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days)
	•	Costs millions
	•	Used by governments / intelligence agencies
	•	Targets specific people

 Prevention
	•	Immediate OS updates
	•	Enable Lockdown Mode (iPhone)
	•	Reduce attack surface (less apps)

In cases of advanced exploit-based or spyware attacks, 
factory resetting or replacing the device may be the safest option.

This is because it is often difficult to determine how deeply the system has been compromised, 
and some sophisticated malware may persist beyond normal removal methods.

When dealing with high-risk infections, relying only on antivirus tools is not always sufficient, 
and starting with a clean device ensures maximum security.
